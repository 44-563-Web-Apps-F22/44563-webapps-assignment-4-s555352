        We'll a memorandum makeâ€”<br>
        Man is Nature's sole mistake!<br><br>

        And thus to empyrean height<br>
        Of ev'ry kind of lore,<br><br>
                    
        In search of wisdom's pure delight,<br>
        Ambitiously we soar.<br><br>
        
        In trying to achieve success<br>
        No envy racks our heart,<br><br>
                    
        For all we know and all we guess<br>
        We mutually impart!<br><br>
        
        And all the knowledge we possess,<br>
        We mutually impart,<br>
        We mutually impart, impart.<br><br>
        
        
        <p style="color:red">(Enter Lady Blanche.  All stand up demurely)</p></h4>
        <h5>Blanche:</h5>
        
            Attention, ladies, while I read to you<br>
            The Princess Ida's list of punishments.<br>
            The first is Sacharissa.  She's expelled!<br>
        
        <h5>All:</h5>Expelled!
        <h5>Blan.:</h5>Expelled, because although she knew<br>
               No man of any kind may pass our walls,<br>
               She dared to bring a set of chessmen here!<br>
        <h5>Sach.:</h5><p style="color:red">(Crying)</p>I meant no harm; they're only men of wood!
        <h5>Blan.:</h5>They're men with whom you give each other mate,<br>
               And that's enough!  The next is Chloe.<br>
        <h5>Chloe:</h5>Ah!
        <h5>Blan.:</h5>Chloe will lose three terms, for yesterday,<br>
               When looking through her drawing-book, I found<br>
               A sketch of a perambulator!
        <h5>All:</h5><p style="color:red">(Horrified)</p>Oh!
        <h5>Blan.:</h5>Double perambulator...
        <h5>All:</h5>Oh, oh!
