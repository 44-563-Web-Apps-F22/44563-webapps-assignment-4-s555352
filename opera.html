        <p>(Enter Lady Blanche.  All stand up demurely)

        Blanche:     Attention, ladies, while I read to you
                     The Princess Ida's list of punishments.
                     The first is Sacharissa.  She's expelled!
      
        All:         Expelled!
      
        Blan.:                  Expelled, because although she knew
                     No man of any kind may pass our walls,
                     She dared to bring a set of chessmen here!
      
        Sach.:       (Crying)  I meant no harm; they're only men of wood!
      
        Blan.:       They're men with whom you give each other mate,
                     And that's enough!  The next is Chloe.
      
        Chloe:                                                      Ah!
      
        Blan.:       Chloe will lose three terms, for yesterday,
                     When looking through her drawing-book, I found
                     A sketch of a perambulator!
      
        All: (Horrified)                                      Oh!
      
        Blan.:       Double perambulator...
      
        All:         Oh, oh!</p>
