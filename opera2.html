            I, madam, on Abstract Philosophy.<br>
            There I propose considering, at length,<br>
            Three points — The Is, the Might Be, and the Must.<br>
            Whether the Is, from being actual fact,<br>
            Is more important than the vague Might Be,<br>
            Or the Might Be, from taking wider scope,<br>
            Is for that reason greater than the Is:<br>
            And lastly, how the Is and Might Be stand<br>
            Compared with the inevitable Must!<br>

            Madam, I take three possibilities,<br>
            And strike a balance then between the three:<br>
            As thus:  The Princess Ida Is our head,<br>
            the Lady Psyche Might Be, — Lady Blanche,<br>
            Neglected Blanche, inevitably Must.<br>
            Given these three hypotheses — to find<br>
            The actual betting against each of them!<br>
